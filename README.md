# really-simple-social-sharing-buttons
Need some social sharing buttons for your WordPress blog like NOW? Tired of dealing with the endless options of all the big-time social sharing plugins out there? Well, congrats on finding your way here. Really Simple Social Sharing Buttons plugin is just that, really simple and social sharing buttons. There is no customization page in the dashboard, nothing to really configure.

Install and activate and the plugin will automatically insert social sharing buttons at the top and bottom of your content. For now, it's just Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn. I will be adding new ones in the future so be sure to check back from time to time for updates.
